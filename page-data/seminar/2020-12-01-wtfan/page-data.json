While significant progress has been made on the fluctuations of the growing random shape, understanding of the optimal paths, or geodesics, is less developed. The Busemann function is a useful analytical tool for studying geodesics. We present the joint distribution of the Busemann functions, simultaneously in all directions of growth, in terms of mappings that represent FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues. As applications of this description we derive a marked point process representation for the Busemann function across a single lattice edge and point out its implication on structure of semi-infinite geodesics. This is joint work with Timo Seppäläinen.</p>","frontmatter":{"affiliation":"Indiana University","date":"2020-12-01 14:00","seminar":"UIUC Probability Seminar Fall 2020","speaker":"Wai-Tong (Louis) Fan","title":"Joint distribution of Busemann functions in corner growth models","posttype":"seminar","place":"in Zoom"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/seminar/2020-12-01-wtfan/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216"]}
