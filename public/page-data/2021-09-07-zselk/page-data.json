As one example of an application of our theorem, we discuss a Feynman-Kac type formula, showing that the solution to a second order linear ODE (or system of ODEs) is the mode of a particular diffusion. Our portmanteau theorem along with our Feynman-Kac result provides numerics and insight for solving these ODEs. Joint work with William Haskell and Harsha Honnappa. </p>","frontmatter":{"affiliation":"Purdue University","date":"2021-09-07 14:00","seminar":"UIUC Probability Seminar Fall 2021","speaker":"Zachary Selk","title":"Information Projections On Banach Spaces With Applications To KL Weighted Control And A Feynman-Kac Formula For ODEs","posttype":"seminar","place":"347 Altgeld Hall"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021-09-07-zselk/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216"]}
