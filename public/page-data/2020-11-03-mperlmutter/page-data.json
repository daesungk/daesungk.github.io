Mallat.  Similar to more traditional CNNs, the scattering transform is a deep, feed-forward network featuring an alternating cascade of convolutions and nonlinearities. However, it differs by using predesigned, wavelet filters rather than filters that are learned from training data. This leads to a network that provably has desirable invariance and stability properties.\nIn addition to preforming well on standard machine learning tasks such as image recognition. The scattering transform can also be used to extract statisical information about stochastic processes with stationary increments. The expected scattering moments are a novel form of nonparametric statistics which can be used to distinguish random textures with identical power spectrums. I will present Mallat's original construction as well as several novel variations designed for structured data such as graphs. In particular, I will discuss the use of one of the more recent construction to distinguish between different types of randomly generated graphs. </p>","frontmatter":{"affiliation":"UCLA","date":"2020-11-03 14:00","seminar":"UIUC Probability Seminar Fall 2020","speaker":"Michael Perlmutter","title":"The Scattering Transform: a Wavelet-based Neural Network for Statistical Feature Extraction","posttype":"seminar","place":"in Zoom"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2020-11-03-mperlmutter/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216"]}
