In this talk, we discuss the equivalence among these and  off-diagonal heat kernel upper bounds under some mild assumptions. Our approach is based on a new generalized  Davies' method. This talk is based on a joint work with Zhen-Qing Chen, Takashi Kumagai and Jian Wang.</p>","frontmatter":{"affiliation":"Seoul National University","date":"2021-08-24 14:00","seminar":"UIUC Probability Seminar Fall 2021","speaker":"Panki Kim","title":"Heat kernel upper bounds for symmetric Markov semigroups","posttype":"seminar","place":"347 Altgeld Hall"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021-08-24-pkim/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216"]}
