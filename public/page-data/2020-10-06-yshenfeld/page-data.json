Remarkably, if in addition to the volume, the average width of the shape is fixed, the optimal solutions become non-unique and non-smooth. This is just a very special instance of optimization problems arising in convex geometry whose optimal solutions are bizarre and still conjectural. In this talk, I will explain how the study of these optimal shapes is intertwined with the spectral structure of a certain diffusion operator on the sphere, and how we (with Ramon van Handel) solved many of these problems. No prior knowledge of convex geometry is assumed.</p>","frontmatter":{"affiliation":"MIT","date":"2020-10-06 14:00","seminar":"UIUC Probability Seminar Fall 2020","speaker":"Yair Shenfeld ","title":"Degenerate diffusions and optimal convex bodies","posttype":"seminar","place":"in Zoom"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2020-10-06-yshenfeld/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216"]}
