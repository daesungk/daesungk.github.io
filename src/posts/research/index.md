##### Research Interest

My research interest lies at the interface of probability and analysis. 

In particular, I am interested in the sharp and quantitative inequalities from probability and analysis, and their applications.

PhD Thesis: *Stability for functional and geometric inequalities and a stochastic representation of fractional integrals and nonlocal operators* (2019) [[PDF]](thesis-daesungk.pdf)

My papers on arXiv can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/a/kim_d_6.html).
