Graph matching, also known as network alignment, refers to finding a bijection between the vertex sets of two given graphs so as to maximally align their edges. This fundamental computational problem arises frequently in multiple fields such as computer vision and biology. In this work we will discuss a new algorithm for exact matching of correlated Erdos-Renyi graphs. Based on joint work with Cheng Mao and Mark Rudelson.
