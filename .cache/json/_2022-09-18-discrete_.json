{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>This project focuses on studying the mathematical models that describe complex interactions with randomness and understanding their statistical properties when their sizes are large enough. The mathematical models of interest include stochastic processes on graphs, the Curie-Weiss models, and the Ising models, which are motivated by network theory, mathematical physics, biology, and social science. In particular, I am interested in the limiting and fluctuation behaviors of the range of random walks on graphs, and the Curie-Weiss model under some constraints.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Limiting Behaviors of Discrete Probability Models","date":"2022-09-18 01:07","posttype":"research"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2022-09-18-discrete/"}}
