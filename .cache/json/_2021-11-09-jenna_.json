Our main result is a short, combinatorial proof of the pointwise ergodic theorem for actions of amenable groups along Tempelman Folner sequences, which is a slightly less general version of Lindenstrauss's celebrated theorem. We will discuss a very short proof (due to Tserunyan) of Birkhoff's classical pointwise ergodic theorem, and, using this proof as an outline, we will sketch the proof of the theorem for Tempelman Folner sequences. This is joint work with Jon Boretsky.</p>","frontmatter":{"affiliation":"UIUC","date":"2021-11-09 14:00","seminar":"UIUC Probability Seminar Fall 2021","speaker":"Jenna Zomback","title":"A tiling proof of the pointwise ergodic theorem for actions of amenable groups along Tempelman Folner sequences","posttype":"seminar","place":"347 Altgeld Hall"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021-11-09-jenna/"}}
