{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>We consider the standard first-passage percolation model on Z^d, in which each edge is assigned an i.i.d. nonnegative weight, and the passage time between any two points is the smallest total weight of a nearest-neighbor path between them.  Our primary interest is in the empirical measures of edge-weights observed along geodesics from 0 to ne_1.  For various dense families of edge-weight distributions, we prove that these measures converge weakly to a deterministic limit as n tends to infinity.  The key tool is a new variational formula for the time constant.  In this talk, I will derive this formula and discuss its implications for the convergence of both empirical measures and lengths of geodesics.</p>","frontmatter":{"affiliation":"UW","date":"2020-09-22 14:00","seminar":"UIUC Probability Seminar Fall 2020","speaker":"Erik Bates","title":"Empirical measures, geodesic lengths, and a variational formula in first-passage percolation","posttype":"seminar","place":"in Zoom"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2020-09-22-ebates/"}}
