{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>It has been known since antiquity that the ball is the unique shape which minimizes surface area among all shapes of equal volume. Remarkably, if in addition to the volume, the average width of the shape is fixed, the optimal solutions become non-unique and non-smooth. This is just a very special instance of optimization problems arising in convex geometry whose optimal solutions are bizarre and still conjectural. In this talk, I will explain how the study of these optimal shapes is intertwined with the spectral structure of a certain diffusion operator on the sphere, and how we (with Ramon van Handel) solved many of these problems. No prior knowledge of convex geometry is assumed.</p>","frontmatter":{"affiliation":"MIT","date":"2020-10-06 14:00","seminar":"UIUC Probability Seminar Fall 2020","speaker":"Yair Shenfeld ","title":"Degenerate diffusions and optimal convex bodies","posttype":"seminar","place":"in Zoom"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/seminar/2020-10-06-yshenfeld/"}}
