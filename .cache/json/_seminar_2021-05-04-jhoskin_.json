{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>In this talk we consider a natural question going back to Saint Venant in 1856: if a beam of constant cross-section is twisted, how large is the maximum shear stress? As it turns out, this problem can be formulated as a basic question about elliptic PDEs which arises in a number of settings, including electrostatics, constrained maximization of the lifetime of Brownian motion started close to the boundary, and optimal Hermite-Hadamard inequalities for subharmonic functions on convex domains. In this talk we will present upper and lower bounds for the largest possible shear stress for convex domains, and discuss extremal shapes.</p>","frontmatter":{"affiliation":"University of Chicago","date":"2021-05-04 14:00","seminar":"UIUC Probability Seminar Spring 2021","speaker":"Jeremy Hoskins ","title":"Towards optimal gradient bounds for torsion functions in the plane","posttype":"seminar","place":"in Zoom"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/seminar/2021-05-04-jhoskin/"}}
