{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Stability for functional and geometric inequalities has been of great interest to many researchers. For an inequality whose optimizers are fully understood, we are interested in the deviation from optimizers when the equality is close to being achieved. There has been considerable progress in this direction. I have focussed on the stability for the logarithmic Sobolev inequality and spectral inequalities arising from the stochastic analysis. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Stability of Functional and Geometric Inequality","date":null,"posttype":"research"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/research/stability/"}}
