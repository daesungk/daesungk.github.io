{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I will present recent results concerning the equivalence between the modified log-Sobolev inequality and a family of Beckner type inequalities with constants uniformly separated from zero. Next I will discuss moment estimates which can be derived from such inequalities, generalizing previous results due to Aida and Stroock, based on a stronger log-Sobolev inequality due to Federbush and Gross. If time permits I will present examples to moment estimates for certain Cauchy type measures, for invariant measures of Glauber dynamics and on the Poisson path space.</p>\n<p>Based on joint work with B. Polaczyk and M.
