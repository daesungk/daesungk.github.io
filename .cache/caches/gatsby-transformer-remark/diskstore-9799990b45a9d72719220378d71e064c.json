Such operators include discrete Riesz transforms and related operators, the fractional integrals and the Fourier multipliers arising from stochastic processes. A central theme of harmonic analysis is to deduce the qualitative properties of such operators from the quantitative analysis. By controlling the size of the output of a transformation by its input, one can say how much the transformation is regular or predictable in a suitable sense. The goal is to provide quantitative estimates of the transformations via stochastic representations, which are usually given by the conditional expectations of martingale transforms. Due to the existence of sharp martingale inequalities and infinite-dimensional nature of martingales, the representation sometimes gives the sharp estimates and dimension-independent constants.</p>"}
