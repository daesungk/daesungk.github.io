The mathematical models of interest include stochastic processes on graphs, the Curie-Weiss models, and the Ising models, which are motivated by network theory, mathematical physics, biology, and social science. In particular, I am interested in the limiting and fluctuation behaviors of the range of random walks on graphs, and the Curie-Weiss model under some constraints.</p>"}
