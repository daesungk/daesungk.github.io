Typically, the existence of multiple points depends on the dimensions of the domain and state space, and the existence problem is more difficult to solve when a random field is in its critical dimension. Under the framework of Dalang, Mueller and Xiao (2017), we prove that for a class of Gaussian random fields, multiple points do not exist in critical dimension. Our approach is based on a covering argument of Talagrand (1998). The result can be applied to fractional Brownian sheets and systems of linear SPDEs such as stochastic heat equations and wave equations driven by space-time white noise or colored noise. Joint work with Robert Dalang, Carl Mueller and Yimin Xiao. </p>"}
