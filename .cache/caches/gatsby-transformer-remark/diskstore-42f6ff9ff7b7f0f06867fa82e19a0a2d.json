This estimation is complicated by the fact that genes evolve under biological processes that produce discordant trees. Such processes include horizontal gene transfer (HGT), incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), and gene duplication and loss (GDL), all of which can be modeled using specialized random tree distributions. I will survey some recent results regarding the analysis of these probabilistic models. Specifically their identifiability, or \"invertibility,\" will be discussed as well as the asymptotic properties of species tree estimation methods (time permitting).
