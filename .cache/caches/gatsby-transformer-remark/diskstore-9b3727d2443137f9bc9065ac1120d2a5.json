While significant progress has been made on the fluctuations of the growing random shape, understanding of the optimal paths, or geodesics, is less developed. The Busemann function is a useful analytical tool for studying geodesics. We present the joint distribution of the Busemann functions, simultaneously in all directions of growth, in terms of mappings that represent FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues. As applications of this description we derive a marked point process representation for the Busemann function across a single lattice edge and point out its implication on structure of semi-infinite geodesics. This is joint work with Timo Seppäläinen.","position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":840,"offset":840}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":840,"offset":840}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":3,"column":1,"offset":841}}}}
