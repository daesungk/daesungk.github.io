The mathematical models of interest include stochastic processes on graphs, the Curie-Weiss models, and the Ising models, which are motivated by network theory, mathematical physics, biology, and social science. In particular, I am interested in the limiting and fluctuation behaviors of the range of random walks on graphs, and the Curie-Weiss model under some constraints.","position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":565,"offset":565}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":565,"offset":565}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":567}}}}
