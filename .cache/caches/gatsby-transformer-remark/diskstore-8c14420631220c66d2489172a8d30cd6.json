Next I will discuss moment estimates which can be derived from such inequalities, generalizing previous results due to Aida and Stroock, based on a stronger log-Sobolev inequality due to Federbush and Gross. If time permits I will present examples to moment estimates for certain Cauchy type measures, for invariant measures of Glauber dynamics and on the Poisson path space.","position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":565,"offset":565}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":565,"offset":565}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Based on joint work with B.
